unscd (0.47-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NB: Because insserv is slightly broken (#606593), we cannot provide
    nscd, as this would break installs which hadn't already purged nscd.
    However, if you have init scripts which depend on nscd, feel free to
    change Provides: unscd to Provides: unscd nscd after purging nscd.
